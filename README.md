# Benchie
A simple, informal benchmarking tool for Java.

The goal is to create an interface for informal benchmarking your Java code that's easier than the usual process: setting the starting time, running code, getting ending time, and then maybe printing to the console. It's for a quick-and-dirty time trial for comparing different algorithms (e.g. proving how fast your solution to a Project Euler problem is). This isn't designed for benchmarking actual production code (good, rigorous benchmarking packages already exist; in fact, Java 9 will be including a built-in micro-benchmarking tool). 

And then there is another personal goal to just dick around in Java.
